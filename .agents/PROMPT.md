1. **Build a Cloudflare Worker** with the following capabilities:

   - **Monitor GitHub Repositories**:
     - Use GitHub's API to monitor all repositories under the GitHub account `jmbish04` or organization.
     - Check for pull requests (PRs) that are ready for review and have Gemini Code Assist comments posted.
     - Automatically:
       - Review and implement Gemini Code Assist recommendations on the identified PRs.
       - Resolve any merge conflicts that arise during the process.
       - Merge the PRs into their respective target branches.
       - Integrate all changes into the `main` branch.
       - Deploy the updated `main` branch to the Cloudflare Worker environment.
       - Log all actions and errors for traceability.

   - **Install Missing Webhooks**:
     - On a configurable Cron schedule (e.g., every hour), use the GitHub API to:
       - Check for new repositories that do not have a webhook installed for events such as `pull_request`, `issue_comment`, or `pull_request_review`.
       - Automatically install the webhook on these repositories if missing.
       - Ensure the webhook points to the Cloudflare Worker endpoint.

   - **Handle Webhook Events**:
     - The Cloudflare Worker should process webhook events related to pull requests, comments, and reviews.
     - Use these events to trigger the automation described above for managing PRs.

2. **Authentication**:
   - Use a GitHub personal access token (PAT) or OAuth for API authentication.
   - Store the token securely using Cloudflare Worker secrets or environment variables.
   - Ensure the token has sufficient permissions to access all repositories, manage webhooks, and interact with pull requests.

3. **Error Handling and Notifications**:
   - Include robust error handling for API rate limits, authentication failures, and any GitHub API errors.
   - Optionally send notifications (e.g., email or Slack) for critical errors or successful deployments.

4. **Configurable Settings**:
   - Allow the following settings to be easily configurable via environment variables:
     - GitHub account or organization to monitor.
     - Cron schedule for checking new repositories.
     - Events to monitor via webhooks.
     - Deployment environment details for the `main` branch.

5. **Testing**:
   - Test the Cloudflare Worker to ensure it can:
     - Detect and process PRs with Gemini Code Assist recommendations.
     - Resolve conflicts, merge branches, and deploy to Cloudflare Workers.
     - Identify and install missing webhooks on new repositories.

6. **Scalability**:
   - Ensure the Cloudflare Worker can handle a large number of repositories and webhook events efficiently.
   - Use batching or pagination for API calls where necessary.
